
This contains a practice portfolio for UCF's Coding Boot Camp. The project is mainly for self-development purposes. It incorporates both HTML and CSS. The aim is to implement 
more readability and accessibility, as well as correct multiple design flaws. In future deployments, the portfolio will be updated to resemble the mock up file more closely. This
project's goal is to showcase advanced CSS knowledge with the use of techniques such as flexbox, media queries, transforms, etc..
